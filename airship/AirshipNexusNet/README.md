# Airship Template Game
Use this repo as a starting point for your future Airship game!  

## Prerequisites
- [Unity 2023.2.3f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2023.2.3) (Unity Hub recommended for installing)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) - Required for the typescript compiler

## Getting started
It's recommended that you open the project in Unity to let Airship set up the project fully.

**Once opened in Unity, open scene "DefaultScene"**, the game should be playable straight away after you see *Compiled Successfully* in the console.

That's it! [check out our docs](https://docs.airship.gg/) for more information on how to develop on Airship.
